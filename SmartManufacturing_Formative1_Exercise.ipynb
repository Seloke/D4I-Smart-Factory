    "Scenario: We have been given data from a spare parts manufacturing plant that uses Fabricating Machines, and skilled Operators to produce spare parts. These are small parts and they are produced in the 100's. The manufacturing plant wants to produce as many parts as possible quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data:** We have given given 1 day's manufacturing data. There are 2 Machines (M1 and M2) and 5 human operators (O1...O5) and on this day 3 parts (P1, P2 and P3) were produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both M1 and M2 have different rates of production, when they are running. However, they both require some set-up time, as well as `change over` time when switching between different parts. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Stoppages__ Throughout the day, these machines get stopped for various reasons. These NPT (non-productive times) are due to the following reasons:\n",
    "1. Alarms (machine parts overheating, high vibrations)\n",
    "2. Operator stops (humans stopping the machines, for taking a break, replacing raw etc.)\n",
    "3. Change over (when switching from one Part to manufacturing another)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal for this lesson**: Compare the throughputs of the different machines, compare part manufacturing difficulty and operator efficiencies, by looking at the data\n"
